**3. Research Results and Commercial Viability**

The restrictions in this Agreement apply to the Infinite-Realities Datasets and any direct derivative works thereof.

- No portion of the Infinite-Realities Datasets (including images, scans, or derivatives containing identifiable data) is included, distributed, or incorporated into any commercial product or service, unless Infinite-Realities grants express written permission for such inclusion.
- Such commercial or profit-seeking product does not rely on the Infinite-Realities Datasets as training data for a commercial AI model, unless separately authorized in writing by Infinite-Realities under a distinct commercial license (see Section II.2).

The Licensee shall ensure that any commercialization of derived Research Results does not incorporate any portion of the biometric data without explicit authorization.
